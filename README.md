  ## Description

  This project was created to allow users to easily and quickly create a README.md for their projects without sacrificing the necessary details or overall professionalism of their README. This project was created using Node.js and Inquirer to prompt users in their terminals to answer a series of questions regarding their desired README. The questions prompt users for the title of their project and information for the Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions sections of their README. The project was made using Node.js and modules fs, inquirer, and util.

  On some questions you may notice '(N/A)' at the end of the question prompt, in which case you can simply press 'enter' to accept '(N/A)' as your response to that question. Otherwise, you must enter something into the text response portions to continue onto the next question. 
  
  Once you have answered every question you will see your responses listed in the terminal along with a message indicating your README has been created.
