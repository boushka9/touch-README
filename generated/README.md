  ## Description

  This project was meant to challenge me to build the back end for an e-commerce site with Express.js API. The project was configured with Sequelized to interact witha MySQL database to perform API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in a Insomnia Core envioronment.

  ## Installation

  Because this project contains only the backend aspects, clone the code to your local environment. Open the integrated terminal and run 'npm i' to install the dependancies. Next, enter your access info for MySQL and run 'SOURCE schema.sql' (if you open the integrated terminal from the root, you will have to enter './db/schema.sql;' instead). Then type 'USE ecommerce_db' to initiallize the database. Next open a new terminal tab and type 'npm run watch' to start the database with nodemon, or 'npm run start' to initialize with node. Then, open another terminal tab and type 'npm run seed' to seed the database once the server is running.

  ## Usage

  Once you have successfully initiated the database, started the server, and seeded the database, you can then begin to test the backend functionality in Insomnia Core.
